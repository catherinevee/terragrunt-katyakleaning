   # For Windows
   .\scripts\security-validation.ps1 install
   ```

### Configuration
1. Update `account.hcl` with your AWS account details (now dynamic)
2. Modify `eu-west-1/prod/env.hcl` for your environment
3. Replace placeholder values (domains, IPs, etc.)

### Deployment with Security Validation
```bash
# Deploy with automatic security validation
cd eu-west-1/prod/kms && terragrunt apply
cd ../iam && terragrunt apply
cd ../vpc && terragrunt apply
cd ../security-groups && terragrunt apply
# ... continue with remaining services
```

Each deployment automatically runs:
- Pre-deployment security scanning
- Compliance validation
- Cost estimation
- Configuration validation

See [DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md) for detailed instructions.

## Security Validation
